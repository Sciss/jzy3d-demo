# jzy-demo

A fork from [here](https://github.com/retronym/jzy3d-demo), bringing it up to latest jzy3d and sbt.
Some Scala demos for the jzy3d plotting library. Original read-me below:

-----------

An [SBT](http://scala-sbt.org) project to demonstrate the excellent [JZY3D](http://jzy3d.org)
scientific plotting library.

Edit `build.sbt` to pick your machine architecture. After this, SBT will download all necessary libraries automatically.

Then you can run the code samples provided by JZY3D, which I've
converted to Scala.

Note that you can't run more than one sample from a single SBT session,
as the native code loading mechanism in SBT doesn't allow for this.

```
$ sbt run
